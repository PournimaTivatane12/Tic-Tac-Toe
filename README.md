# ðŸŽ® Tic-Tac-Toe in Java using DSA Concepts

A simple **Tic-Tac-Toe game** built using **Java** and basic **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** concepts like arrays and loops. This project is a great way to practice logical thinking, array usage, and control flow in Java. The game is built to run on the command line and supports 2-player gameplay.
